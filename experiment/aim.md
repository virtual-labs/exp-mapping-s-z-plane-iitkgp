### Aim of the experiment

1. Mapping the pole-zero locations of s plane into z plane.

2. Try for various pole-zero locations in s plane corresponding to

    i) Constant Damping ratio &zeta; ,

    ii) Constant Attenuation &sigma; ,

    iii) Constant Frequency &omega;,

    Check corresponding z domain mapping.
